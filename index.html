      Today we're conquering our fears and making homemade croissants! If you're
      about to run away screaming, I understand. I'm not sugarcoating it:
      croissants aren't easy. Croissants require time, patience, and a lot of
      rolling. However, just because this recipe is advanced doesn't mean that
      YOU have to be an advanced baker to try it. You can absolutely handle this
      quintessential baking bucket list recipe. â™¥
      <br />
      <br />
      Let me hold your hand through the whole process. I'm sharing step-by-step
      photography, a full video tutorial, plenty of tricks based on what I've
      learned, and the croissant recipe. I started working on croissants earlier
      this year. I studied a couple recipes, tested them, tweaked what I found
      necessary, and played with this dough for weeks. The croissants are golden
      brown, extra flaky, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and
      unbelievable warm from the oven. One bite of this delicate French pastry
      will immediately transport you to a quaint French bakery. I'm confident in
      this homemade croissants recipe and I'm confident in YOU baking them.

      The good news! You need zero fancy equipment and zero special ingredients.
      If you're looking for a weekend project, know how to read directions, and
      crave a fresh homemade pastry (don't we all?), then stick around. You'll
      be rewarded with the BEST treat ever!!!
